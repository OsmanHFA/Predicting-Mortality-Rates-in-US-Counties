# Predicting-Mortality-Rates-in-US-Counties
Using online healthcare datasets, I developed multiple regression models to predict the mortality rate of residents in US counties

# Project Methodology:
- Implemented a robust data preprocessing pipeline to clean, impute missing values, and standardize the training data for accurate model training.
- Employed cross-validation techniques to ensure the models generalization ability and mitigate overfitting issue
- Conducted comprehensive model evaluation by assessing performance metrics on independent test data.
- Received exceptional feedback on the project and achieved a grade of 80% for the deliverables.

# Project Deliverables:
1. Linear Regression Model
2. Lasso Regression Model
3. Ridge Regression Model
4. Random Forest Regression Model
5. Statistical Analysis and Comparison of Results from all Models

# Project Location: See Jupyter Notebook
